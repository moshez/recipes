------------------

The quantities are for about 12-14 pancakes.

Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~

* 5 matzas
* 3/4 cup milk
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 tbsp canola oil

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Break all matzas into small pieces in a large mixing bowel.
Pour the salt and the milk on the broken matzas mix and let stand for
10-15 minutes.
Add the eggs the mixture and let stand for another 5 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan.
When hot, reduce heat to medium-low.

Create pseudo pancakes,
using a large table spoon.
Put a heaping table spoon of mixture in the hot pan.
If it's the heap is too steep, flatten it a little.

Leave space between the pancakes:
in a large pan you can fry 4-5 pancakes at a time.
Fry for about 3-4 minutes, until golden-brown.
Turn over to the other side and fry for about 2-3 more minutes.
Remove from pan to plate covered with a paper towel to absorb extra oil.

Mujaddara
---------

Mujaddara, or majadra,
is a middle-eastern dish.
As many of those,
it has many variants.
I believe the variant described here is the Iraqi one --
in any case, that's the one traditional in my family.

Ingredients
===========

* 1 cup rice (Indian)
* 1/2 cup lentils (orange)
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1tbs oil (canola)
* 2 1/4 cups of water
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper

Preperation
===========

* Mix rice and lentils in a bowel.
* Wash, until water is clear.
* Drain all extra water.
* Put the rice into a pot.
* Add oil and garlic and mix well.
* Add water.
* Bring to boil in an un-covered pot.
* When water boils, cover the pot and reduce heat to low.
* Simmer for about 15-20 minutes.

Baking
~~~~~~

* Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.
* Line a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.
* Transfer the dough on to a large, lightly floured work surface.
* Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out as thin as possible.
* Get it to a 26-by-18-inch rectangle, or even larger if you can.
* Position the dough lengthwise in front of you.
* Spread half of the tomato sauce over the middle third.
* Sprinkle with half of the cheese.
* Fold the two sides over on to the sauce so that they overlap by only a few inches in the middle.
* Spread the remaining sauce over the left two thirds of the dough.
* Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese.
* Fold the righthand unsauced side over the middle part of the sauced side.
* Fold the lefthand sauced side over that, like folding a letter.
* Fold the dough crosswise.
* Tuck the whole thing into the prepared loaf pan.
* Brush the top with olive oil.
* Bake in the oven for about 1 hour.
* Immediately invert the scaccia onto a rack.
* Remove the loaf pan and parchment paper.
* Let the loaf cool in this position for 10 minutes.
* Turn the loaf right-side-up.
* Slice into thick pieces and serve warm.
